/*
This method uses the Pattern and Matcher classes from the java.util.regex package to define regex rules for the username and password, and then checks if the input strings match those rules using the Matcher.matches() method.

Here are the regex rules used in this method:

usernameRegex: Allows usernames that are at least 3 characters long and consist of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, dots (.), underscores (_), and hyphens (-).
passwordRegex: Allows passwords that are at least 8 characters long and contain at least one letter (both uppercase and lowercase) and one digit. It also allows special characters such as @, $, !, %, *, #, ?, and &.
Note that these regex rules are just examples, and you can modify them to suit your specific requirements.

"^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{3,}$"
Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

^ - matches the start of the string
[a-zA-Z0-9._-] - matches any character that is an uppercase or lowercase letter, a digit, a dot, an underscore, or a hyphen
{3,} - specifies that the previous character set can appear three or more times
$ - matches the end of the string
So, the pattern as a whole matches any string that consists of only letters, digits, dots, underscores, or hyphens and is at least three characters long. It does not allow any other characters in the string, such as spaces or special characters.

"^(?=.*[A-Za-z])(?=.*\\d)[A-Za-z\\d@$!%*#?&]{8,}$";
^ - matches the start of the string
(?=.*[A-Za-z]) - positive lookahead assertion that checks if the string contains at least one letter (uppercase or lowercase)
(?=.*\\d) - positive lookahead assertion that checks if the string contains at least one digit
[A-Za-z\\d@$!%*#?&]{8,} - matches any character that is a letter (uppercase or lowercase), a digit, or one of the special characters @, $, !, %, *, #, ?, or &, and is at least 8 characters long
$ - matches the end of the string
So, the pattern as a whole matches any string that:

contains at least one letter and one digit
is at least 8 characters long
can contain letters, digits, and the special characters @, $, !, %, *, #, ?, or &
This pattern can be used to validate passwords, as it ensures that they are strong enough to be considered secure. The positive lookahead assertions ((?=.*[A-Za-z]) and (?=.*\\d)) are used to ensure that the password contains both letters and digits, while the character set [A-Za-z\\d@$!%*#?&] and the minimum length requirement of 8 characters ensure that the password is not too weak. Note that this pattern is just an example, and different use cases may require different regex patterns to validate passwords.
