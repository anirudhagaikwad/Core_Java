Write a JAVA program to calculate volume of tetrahedron.

A Tetrahedron is simply a pyramid with a triangular base.
It is a solid object with four triangular faces, three on the sides or lateral faces,
one on the bottom of the base and four vertices or corners.
If the faces are all congruent equilateral triangles, then the tetrahedron is called regular.


The volume of the tetrahedron can be found by using the following formula :
Volume = a3/(6âˆš2)

Examples :
Input : side = 3
Output: 3.18

Input : side = 20
Output: 942.81

        double volume = (Math.pow(side, 3) / (6 * Math.sqrt(2)));
        return volume;
