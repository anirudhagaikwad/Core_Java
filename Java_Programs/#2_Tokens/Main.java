/*
The program simulates interaction between a microcontroller and a communication interface using bitwise operators. The microcontroller has eight output pins, and the communication interface sends binary data that the microcontroller interprets to set the state of the pins.

The Pin class represents an output pin on the microcontroller. It has a constructor that takes a pin number, and two methods setHigh() and setLow() that set the pin to a high or low state, respectively. In this program, the setHigh() and setLow() methods simply print a message to the console indicating the pin number and the state that it was set to.

The CommunicationInterface class simulates a communication interface that sends binary data to the microcontroller. It has a receive() method that returns a byte array representing the binary data that was received. In this program, the receive() method generates random binary data to simulate receiving data from a communication interface.

The Main class is the main entry point for the program. It initializes eight Pin objects to represent the output pins on the microcontroller, and an instance of the CommunicationInterface class to represent the communication interface. The main loop of the program waits for incoming data from the communication interface, extracts the binary value from the received data, and sets the state of each pin based on the binary value using bitwise operators.

The bitwise operators used in the program are the binary AND operator (&) and the binary OR operator (|). The AND operator is used to extract individual bits from the binary value by performing a bitwise AND operation with a mask. The mask is a binary value with a 1 in the position of the bit that we want to extract, and 0s in all other positions. For example, to extract the first bit from a binary value, we can use the mask 0x01, which has a 1 in the first position and 0s in all other positions. The AND operation with the mask will result in either 0 or 1, depending on the value of the first bit in the binary value. The OR operator is used to set the state of the pins based on the binary value. To set a pin to a high state, we perform a bitwise OR operation with a mask that has a 1 in the position of the pin that we want to set, and 0s in all other positions. To set a pin to a low state, we perform a bitwise AND operation with a mask that has a 0 in the position of the pin that we want to set, and 1s in all other positions.
